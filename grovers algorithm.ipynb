    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this assignment our goal is to expand on the quantum search algorithm devised by Lou Grover in 1996. We will address the classical problem solved by the algorithm, additionally we will elaborate on the physics behind the algorithm and lastly we will discuss its advantages over classical search algorithms. We will also provide Python code where we implement Grover's algorithm and we will comment on its expected success in retrieving entries from large data sets. [1]\n",

    "Typically when one has to find a specific object that lies in a large array of objects, the standard procedure is to explicitly check all of them one by one. Say for instance that we are interested in a specific telephone number's owner. What we would do is to get a telephone book or more generally a telephone directory and start comparing our entry to all of the entries in the book, one at a time. Statistics dictates that on average we are going to need N/2 tries which we will from now on call queries, before we will find the correct entry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity is a representation of the time taken by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function relative to the size of the input data. This property is commonly expressed in $\\mathcal{O}$ (\"Big O\") notation which represents the upper bound of the number of steps needed to solve the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of quantum computing, Grover's algorithm seeks to find a particular element with $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ time complexity by utilising quantum entanglement to solve this classical problem faster than the classical method described above. [3], [1]"

Given a classical array of N objects, we seek to find the placement of one of them, meaning that we know the value of that $a_i$ which implies that we can distinguish it from the others, but not its placement $i$, which will be the incentive in our inquiry. We will assign a quantum state indexed by the placement number (written in base 2) to each of the entries.\n",

In order to create such superposition we begin from N different qubits, all of which are in the down state $\\vert 0 \\rangle$.

What we come to realise is that by expanding the tensor product we can obtain an entantangled uniform superposition. \n",

    "- It is time we put all the ingredients together. Grover's algorithm starts with the uniform superposition obtained in (3) and acts on it first by (4). What this amounts to, is having flipped the phase of the classical string $x_i$ which we are trying to allocate within the initial array (1). Afterwards we act on the state with (6) which now lowers all entries but amplifies $x_i$. We then proceed by flipping the phase of the $x_i$ string again. Now it becomes positive but substantially larger than the rest that were reduced by (6). So we have started with a uniform superposition and have made $x_i$ the predominant component of this state. If we are to iterate this procedure, all components other than the one we are searching for are greatly diminished and the superposition in the limit becomes the quantum state associated with the classical index we are looking for.\n",

    "## Convergence Criteria\n",

    "At the optimal number of iterations, the superposition tends to a single qubit state that corresponds to the classical base 2 string $x_0$. All we need to do is make a measurement on the superposition state, and with almost absolute certainty, we can retrieve the desired 'target' state.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to note that if we continue the algorithm for more iterations than $m$, the amplitude will drop again with a functional form $\\sin^2(m)$. However we will not expand further on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum nature of the algorithm now shows its advantage over the classical calculations, since for a large number of objects, we can easily see that $\\sqrt{N} \\ll \\frac{N}{2}$. Consequently, Grover triumphs over classical computing. [2]\n"

    "As we can see in the above test data, our implementation of Grover's algorithm finds the target qubit every single time. Each step of the Grover's operator increases the amplitude of the desired state(s) and reduces the amplitude of the other states. This code has been robustly tested for 1 and 2 needles in problem sizes ranging from $n^2$ to $n^{10}$. We can observe a steep rise in computation time for $n>10$. Therefore, this code and the framework Qutip are not viable choices for these larger problems, and custom code to efficiently handle Grover's circuit must be implemented."
